    <h1>Coin Commission</h1>  
    <p>Commissioned work for Paul Smith (UK British Fashion designer) shop In London Heathrow Airport.

Me and my farther were commissioned an interior design fabrication job in 2020 for Paul Smith’s clothing store in the duty free section @ Londons busiest airports of Heathrow terminal 3 - the international terminal.

The job consisted of thousands of 1 penny coins, as-well as copper and brass brackets to frame the large scale walls together. The commission of work took just under 4 months to complete and it is and forever will be my favourite piece of art I have ever done. In an uncertain time of the Pandemic, working alongside my farther when I had recently dropped out of university, it gave me a purpose again. It really felt the penny’s really did bring good-luck. </p>

    <h1>Women in Sport</h1>
    <p>In 2020 for a university project I was asked to create a series of poster designs that would uplift and empower women. I selected the topic of women in sport. Being the Olympic year – which later got postponed due to the pandemic, using this as my muse.
        My posters tied in the Olympic colours. I had the idea to adopt the concept similar to the games using red, green, yellow, black and blue. The concept would also highlight the diversity of the games and mixed cultures around the world. With the traditional colours chosen I decided to enhance and alter the hues with vibrancy – I also used the influence of pop culture to achieve a more eye catching appeal. I wanted to also include, different body types, people with disabilities, and mums to be – pregnant women. I wanted all people to feel seen and heard.
        A few years later in 2022, my project got picked up by a gallery in London (Zara gallery) which was held in an exhibition for 2 weeks. The exhibit was aimed at recognising athlete artists in the UK and highlighting their creativity whilst trying to achieve their goals on the track in pursuit of Olympic dreams.</p>

    <h1>USF athletics Kit</h1>
    <p>In the early months of 2022, I was given an opportunity to redesign our USF athletic T&F uniforms. Originally, I was not commissioned to create such designs, but after the first draft of potential uniforms were expressed, all athletes were not impressed by what would have been our new kit. So I expressed an interest to come up with several better designs. I had 2 weeks to produce new designs, which would later be viewed by the head of the athletic department to see if they were accepted.
        To my luck, the board were very happy with the new designs and the next season the uniform was made.</p>

    <h1>Logo Designs</h1>
    <p>Amongst all my commissioned work, I also like to have an ongoing passion project that keeps my creative mind alive. Over the years I have generated several logo ideas, weather that be for university projects or friends and other creative artists.
        I think my preferred medium is black fine liner or biro (of all colours). I like to create fun and unusual characters, often mixing real life objects with human forms. I also like to create patterns and textures, as occasionally having a caterlog of previous designs comes in handy.
        Here is just a few examples of my most recent illustrations.</p>
